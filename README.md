# Decentralized Education Credential Management System

## Overview
A pair of Stacks blockchain smart contracts designed to manage course completions and credit transfers in a decentralized educational ecosystem.

## Course Completion Contract

### Key Features
- Course creation
- Course completion tracking
- Institutional verification

### Core Functions
- `create-course`
    - Allows institutions to define courses
    - Specify course name and completion criteria
    - Generates unique course ID

- `complete-course`
    - Verify and record student course completion
    - Institution-only authorization
    - Prevents duplicate completions

- `get-course`
    - Retrieve course details
    - Public course information lookup

- `is-course-completed`
    - Check individual student course completion status

## Credit Transfer Contract

### Key Features
- Credit award management
- Inter-institutional credit transfers
- Granular credit tracking

### Core Functions
- `award-credits`
    - Institutions can award credits to students
    - Accumulative credit system
    - Tracks credits per institution and student

- `transfer-credits`
    - Move credits between institutions
    - Validates sufficient credit balance
    - Maintains credit transfer integrity

- `get-credits`
    - Retrieve credit balance for specific student and institution

## Error Handling
- Unauthorized action prevention
- Invalid course checks
- Duplicate completion restrictions
- Credit transfer validation

## Security Mechanisms
- Institution-based authentication
- Preventing duplicate course completions
- Credit transfer validation
- Transparent credit tracking

## Potential Improvements
- Credit expiration mechanisms
- More complex credit transfer rules
- Integration with reputation systems
- Cross-institutional credit validation

## Use Cases
- Decentralized educational credentialing
- Transparent academic record-keeping
- Simplified credit transfer processes
- Blockchain-based academic verification

## System Benefits
- Immutable course and credit records
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Enhanced trust in academic credentials
- Simplified inter-institutional cooperation

## Deployment Considerations
